# Simon Game

This game was developed as one of <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp's</a> advanced front-end projects. The goal was to create my own version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)" target="_blank">Simon</a>, a memory-based game where the user has to watch a set of four buttons light up in a specific sequence. After the user successfully replicates the sequence via button presses, a new light is added to the sequence and another round begins. Each time the pattern is longer and thus the difficulty increases, with the ultimate goal being to remember a sequence of 20 lights!
